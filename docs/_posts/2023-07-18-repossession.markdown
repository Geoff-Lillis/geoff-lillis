# Repossession

Jack returned to the living room with a tray. Stale biscuits. Mismatched mugs and instant coffee. Sugar, bagged, but no milk. "I haven't entertained much lately." He spoke closer to gruffness than apology.

"This is great," Claire said, reaching for a biscuit, "and I'm really grateful for the towel."

She twisted more rainwater from her hair, her eyes focused on the towel. He stared at her, unblinking.

"So what do they want now? With respect, the last two thugs they sent couldn't take from me. I don't think a girl like you will have better luck."

She folded the towel and looked for a clear surface.

"Maybe if they'd got caught in the rain like I did you'd have asked them in too."

He grunted, an unpractised laugh. She smiled.

"To answer your question, they'd like me to drive out of here in your car and sell it for them."

Jack stared as Claire sipped her coffee, too hot without milk. No tics, no twitches, strong eye contact. She was serious.

Until she laughed.

"I'm afraid you're behind on your payments. They do have the legal right to seize it. And Mr Dunleary, if you want to give me those keys I'll drive it over to the auction lot right now. They're open all night. But I don't see a way I'll take anything from you without your say so."

"I never thought those bastards would give me a laugh." Jack cracked a half biscuit. "What are they thinking, sending girls out on their own?"

"I guess they don't really care about us contractors. That, and I requested it."

That look of resolve again. He started to laugh, fading to a cough when she didn't join in.

"Mr Dunleary, do you like the bank? Do you think they're a particularly ethical institution?"

Jack wiped crumbs from his lips, shaking them on the floor.

"They're trying to steal my house. My car. They've taken everything else. What I think of them I won't say in front of a woman."

"I'm sorry. Truly. Believe me: I'd rather work anywhere else. You know how they treat their customers. You can guess how they treat their contractors."

She paused.

"It's no place for a woman to work." Jack said. She didn't reply.

"It took me a while to make peace with working there. To find something good in it." She broke eye contact and opened her purse.

"Ever see one of these?"

She offered him a small circuit board, about the size of her phone.

"I'm a plumber, not an electrician."

"It's an OBD2 board." She explained. "My dad is a mechanic. Well, he was, before they took his garage."

His eyes softened at this. She placed the board on the tray between them, just outside his reach. Neutral territory.

"If you want to check out a car, you plug in to one of these boards. It'll tell you about the mileage, the engine, the gearbox, the maintenance history, and if you've been indicating the right way on roundabouts." She punctuated with a sip of coffee, "Unless it doesn't."

"I don't need car maintenance tips from a girl barely old enough to drive," he snorted "What's this got to do with me?"

"It gets me paid and makes your loan records disappear."

This time his laugh was real.

"Sounds like you've been reading too much Harry Potter."

And yet his eyes lingered on the device. Claire watched his face for growing signs of curiosity.

"You're wondering how, Mr Dunleary. But I'd have to get in your car to show you."

Jack sat, his breathing slower now, the rain filling the silence between them while he weighed the risk. One girl, he thought. Half his size. He'd let her in this far. He grunted, then stood to show her through the kitchen to the garage's door.

He pushed the door halfway open then squeezed through sideways, his stomach struggling against the wood. Once inside he turned on the light, illuminating overflowing boxes, tools piled in heaps alongside piping and parts, all shoved to one side of the room to create a narrow walkway. Beyond this Claire saw the car.

"They took my van at the start of the summer." He said. "From the driveway. Left the tools on the street. Parts too. Cost me a contract. A big one. If they get my car too I can't work."

"And that's why you moved the car in here?" Claire asked. Anger flashed across his face, then faded. His answer was a grunt.

He unlocked the car but kept the keys. Claire leaned in, clipping a small Bluetooth transmitter to the underside of his steering wheel then stepping back, feeling Jack's unease. As she retreated he took the driver's seat, calmer now, turning the key a half click. The dashboard lit. Her phone beeped and she showed him an app loading, making its connection first to the transmitter and then to his engine.

"See?" She tapped the screen, and Jack found his eyes drawn to her professionally lacquered nail tapping the expensive phone. He wondered what she'd spent. "That's a well maintained vehicle. You obviously take care of it. Green lights everywhere. Stats like that, this model, you could get fifteen grand at auction. But if we do this..."

She removed the Bluetooth transmitter and connected it to her circuit board, then hit 'new car' on her phone. The background colour snapped from green to red, the engine registering as a fire hazard, the gearbox as counterfeit. The dates of two illegal odometer resets followed.

Jack looked at the circuit board properly for the first time before letting out a slow whistle.

"Nice trick. How does that help me?"

Instead of replying she motioned for him to remove the car key. They danced awkwardly in the confined space before she refound her footing and spoke.

"Say I bring them this car with this circuit board plugged in. They see that readout: it's a write off. They'll auction it for scrap. Now let's say you happen to be there. You get nostalgic and you put your hand up. You win that auction. You own the car. Free and clear. No more bank hassling you. No more payments. Shouldn't cost you more than three hundred bucks: you swap the circuit board back and it's good as new. Then you can drive laps in the bank car park if you like. They can't touch you."

Jack's mind raced with the unfamiliar experience of hope. The chance to win a battle in this one-sided war of attrition. Maybe they wouldn't be able to take it all, he thought. Then the excitement fell from his face.

"No way in hell you pull that off without the bank catching you. And the auction house. They've got mechanics."

"This won't be my first time," she started, slowing her voice as he had quickened his. "The bank's a mess. The departments don't talk. I do houses and cars: they gave me two different IDs to get into the same office. No one cares what we get back on repossessions because our cut comes from the size of the loan, not the auction result. Most times it'd be cheaper to write off the debts than pay us. They can't do that because it makes their loan books look bad. Makes the regulators start asking questions, and you know they don't want that. You're worried about the auction house? No one in there is going to check. They pay some guy fourteen bucks an hour to write numbers from this app onto a clipboard. He's got no reason to think we'd lie about the car being a write off. Even if he did he's not paid enough to care."

She stood taller now, a half step forward, winning back space she'd lost to his gesturing. He hadn't moved but his presence reduced.

"What are you really risking, Jack? Another few weeks sneaking around, maybe, before someone with a tow truck catches you parked outside some bar? They've already taken it from you. The enjoyment of it. The freedom of it. You want that back, you'll take the risk."

He touched only the edges of the circuit board, rough fingers held back from delicate wires. Nervous now. He had already seen so much crushed. She touched his wrist.

"You said three hundred bucks." He started. "You said it like it's not a lot of money. I can't swing that by Thursday. Half. Maybe."

Claire paused, considering.

"Look, like I said I get paid a cut of what you owe for the car, not what it goes for at auction. The bank's going to take the loss here. So I can give you this and still make money."

Jack looked at the ten $20 bills as she took them from her purse. Close. He wanted to touch them. Feel the clean fibres, fresh from the atm. Not hard won from housewives paying him tens and fives for handyman jobs. His mind raced. In what world did kids have that while he had to cut lawns?

He moved to turn her down. His pride was worth something, he thought: he would not be humiliated for two hundred bucks.

She watched him, measuring time, waiting till words were almost on his lips before she spoke.

"Of course, once you legally own it, there's nothing stopping you from selling it."

He paused, knowing she was right, angry that he hadn't thought of it. He could buy something cheaper and free up some cash. Something that would look right on a construction site, he decided. And maybe make a mortgage payment. Get a bit of breathing room while he waited out the recession. Some peace. It would feel good to pay them with their own money, he thought. He watched his hand stretch out for her money and did not try to stop it.

"Like you said. What have I got to lose?" He handed her his keys with his left hand, holding her money in his right. "At least this way they'll have to work for it." he said, folding the bills into his wallet, taking care to keep the edges aligned.

Instead of leaving she reached back into her handbag. "I just need your signature on two documents and then I can get out of your hair."

Jack wanted her gone but experience had taught him to read bank documents closely. The first was a release, saying that Claire Atkins was a registered agent of the bank who had his permission to enter the property. "It's so people don't invite us in then sue us for trespass" she explained. Jack wondered if anyone had pulled that off before they started sending out waivers. And why could they never call it his home? They always had to call it 'the property'.

The second document needed special attention. This one acknowledged that he had failed to keep up payments on a loan number longer than his arm and that he was freely surrendering the keys to the nominated bank agent. The paragraph below told him that the repossession didn't include contents. He drained a half tank of petrol in case the auction house siphoned. Claire nodded approvingly. He laughed at the section saying that his credit score had been negatively affected.

Handing her back the forms he finished clearing his car boot then waved her off before pouring something stronger than coffee to celebrate.

Dave wasn't so much a friend as someone who went to the same bar, but he did have a truck. Jack would need to tow his supposedly written off car off the lot. He'd also need a lift to the auction: Dave was interested enough in the story to do the job for the promise of beer money in weeks to come.

Jack had been coy with the details, enjoying building the suspense. He'd bet Dave a beer that he could fix up a scrappage car in under two minutes. Dave accepted. Jack decided ahead of time that he wouldn't collect on that bet. Wouldn't be right. They walked the lot before taking their seats, talking about imports, jobs, bad drivers. Sober conversation with Dave was easier than he'd thought, and Jack started to like the idea of letting him in on the secret.

"Man, she's set you up!"

Dave's whisper stretched back five rows of the otherwise silent auction room.

"No, we're in the clear." Jack started "We win this auction, I get a fifteen grand car for a couple of hundred bucks."

"Jack, think about it. She knows how much that car is worth. And she knows how much money you have. All she has to do is outbid you."

Jack grabbed the rear of the seat in front of him. Dave watched Jack's knuckles whiten as the entire row began to shake.

"That bitch." Jack said. How had he been so stupid? She came to his house from the bank with a purse stuffed full of twenties and he saw her as someone to trust.

He searched for hope. Just because it was a good plan didn't mean Claire had thought of it. Maybe she was just happy with the repo payout. Maybe, he thought, she was one of those schmucks who want to fix other people's problems and make the world a better place.

Or maybe she took his car off him for two hundred bucks.

A hatred grew inside him as his car's lot number was called.

Fifty dollars.

A hundred.

A hundred and fifty.

Two hundred.

Panic gripped him as he realised that the only other bidder was on the wrong end of a telephone cord. Couldn't even look him in the eye while she robbed him.

Two fifty.

Three hundred.

Three fifty.

Four hundred.

Jack paused, then nodded.

Four fifty.

"What are you bidding with?" Dave asked, knowing Jack's limit from the mix of clean and crumpled bills he now held in both hands.

"Come on man. You're not going to let her do me like this."

Five hundred on the phone. Dave grabbed Jack's arm so he couldn't bid.

"I ain't covering that."

Going once!

"Dave I'll pay you back. If I get it I'll sell the car. If I don't, at least I'll have cost that cunt a few hundred extra."

Going twice!

"You're paying back double."

With that, Dave let go of Jack's arm. He'd left no time for haggling.

"Six hundred!" Jack shouted, immediately regretting not going lower.

"Going once!"

The phone operator shook her head.

Jack scanned the room for any sign of Claire, now unsure if it had even been her on the phone.

"Going twice!"

Jack looked for anyone. Any movement. His hands balled into fists, breath coming quickly as he glowered through the disinterested room.

"Sold!"

No applause. No congratulations. The crowd saw a man who'd made a scene and paid six hundred for three hundred dollars worth of scrap metal. He looked at Dave who he now owed three hundred for a loan of one-fifty.

"Well done" Dave offered to a frosty response. They drove two blocks in silence. Jack reconnected the circuit board like Claire had shown him and they parted ways.

-----

For the first time in a long time Jack rolled down his window and looked around his neighbourhood. It had looked better, by his memory, but like so many things that afternoon it seemed to carry promise. A woman he didn't recognise was cutting her hedge. He stretched an arm out the window of his car and waved.

His car.

It felt good to think that phrase. "My car" he spoke aloud. And again, louder. Just then, anything felt possible. Maybe Claire wasn't the only one who could pull that trick. Maybe Dave could get his hands on some old circuit boards. Dave wasn't so bad, he thought. A real asshole would've bid against him. And one of the guys down the bar was good with computers: he could probably work out how to change the readout. There could be proper money to be made with this. What was Claire going to do - call the cops and say he'd muscled in on her scam?

That was the problem with women, he thought. Good with people, bad with business. She could have been making something big, not wasting her time with a nickel and dime revenge scheme.

He rounded the final corner, slower now. He'd have to sell the car, at least temporarily, and he wanted to savour this trip.

An old man walked his dog nearby. Jenkins, he thought, or something like that.

"Hey neighbour!" Jack shouted, giving an exaggerated thumbs up. The old man stopped, made eye contact, then lowered his gaze.

Odd, Jack thought, but nothing could dent this mood.

Until he saw his lawn.

-----

He sped up, prickly sweat rushing his palms while a tremor took his fine motor control. He clipped the kerb as the car coasted to a halt, blocking traffic with the door open. Using his driveway was not an option: his living room furniture blocked the way.

He stared at the lawn, looking at his bed, complete with months old sheets and black plastic bags full of his clothes. At its foot was his washer dryer, leaning at an angle, leaking suds into dying grass. Where were his tools? His TV? He ran to the front door, weaving through clumps of old newspapers, tinned food, vinyl records and linen. The lock shimmered in the afternoon sun, a wisp of sawdust at its base hammering home its newness.

Willing it to not be true he forced his key to the opening. Pushing. Shouting. Praying. Nothing. He took a half step backwards and saw the foreclosure notice. Forty-eight hours to clear his property from the bank's lawn. Anything later would be trespassing. Next to it, laminated copies of two documents that brought him to his knees. His signature at the bottom of both, the impossibly long loan number on one, the other affirming that Claire Atkins was a registered agent of the bank who had his permission to enter the property.

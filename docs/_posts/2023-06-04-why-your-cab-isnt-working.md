- It's not you, it's the process

The ancient Romans brought us much - language, roads, cement and politics. One offering less celebrated is augury, a system of divination by which those suitably qualified could compare planned actions against the will of the gods.

Augurs did this by watching the flight pattern of birds. They used the observed location and plumage to identify divine will and from this they approved or denied proposed changes. They had special hats which they wore for this occasion.

There are few among us who would consider this a reliable method of change enablement but historians assure us that the practice lasted for centuries. Augury was used to decide the ultimate location of Rome. Augury approved or rejected battle strategies. Festivals were cancelled if owls hooted at an inauspicious time.

## What of Change Advisory Boards?

Augury died out not in response to its ineffectiveness, but rather through the growth of haruspicy, a practice where the gods revealed their preferences through the reading of poultry innards. To the best of my knowledge neither approach to change enablement has yet been put to the rigours of the scientific method. Up till a half decade ago, the same could have been said of Change Advisory Boards.

In "Accelerate!" (2018, Trade Select) Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim analysed three years of data from thousands of industry professionals and found the following:

* CABs do not reduce your risk of failure
* CABs make you slower to recover from failure
* CABs increase your work in progress
* CABs increase your lead times
* CABs slow feedback to your teams
* CABs decrease how often you deploy, resulting in larger, riskier changes
* CABs are correlated with low performing organisations

I'd summarise by saying that they fail in their key objective while also hurting your ability to experiment, deliver value and improve. 

This book came out in 2018. In 2019, ISMS dropped references to CABs. A great number of successful, regulated companies are enabling change without them.

## What Should You Do Instead?

* **Get allies.** You're likely working with people who want safe, reliable production changes and aren't wedded to a particular methodology. They probably don't look forward to the weekly meeting.
* **Focus on better, not perfect.** What changes can you get to a low risk, pre-approved state? It is easier to winnow the sphere of a CAB than to close it overnight.
* **Measure the effectiveness of your current CAB.** Set up alerting whenever a production change occurs, including exactly what changed and when. You may be surprised to see the delta with approved changes.
* **Get familiar with companies in your industry that aren't using CABs.** Many of them give details of what they're doing instead. Be prepared to offer examples.
* **Don't mention augurs, funny hats, or the inadequacies of Roman military decision making.** Cynical approaches designed to drive website traffic are effective in their sphere, but should not be deployed against one's colleagues.
* **Find the biggest growth opportunity.** Which teams consume the most of the CAB's capacity? Are they given the appropriate support to improve their deployment approaches to get to a lower risk rating? Is your internal billing set up to reflect the costs they're incurring to the CAB, and the wider business? Be wary of a situation where a team is choosing between using their budget to fix their deployment issues or sending low quality work to the CAB who'll absorb the risk for free.
* **Reward good behaviour.** Teams that consistently work to make low risk, repeatable changes should have less paperwork to fill than teams who do not.

Do you see a benefit to CABs that I've missed? Let me know in the comments.
